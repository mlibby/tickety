tickety is a simple time tracking tool.

Basically we're talking about a stopwatch here, folks.

You press the big button to get started.

You press the big button again to get stopped.

The results of your efforts are logged.

Planned features:

1. Track time against specific tasks and keep history.
   a. Single task naming and store in log file
   b. Recent history of task names
   c. Tracking tasks across multiple intervals

2. Reminder pop-up and auto-stop.
   a. Pop up window, "Are you still working on $(TASK)?"
   b. Assume task is complete if no response

tickety is written in C using the Gtk2 widget library.
